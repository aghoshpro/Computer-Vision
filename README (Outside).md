## **Datasets**
1. [COCO 2017 Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/awsaf49/coco-2017-dataset)
2. [COCO 2017 Object Detection Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/moeinshariatnia/coco-2017-object-detection-dataset)
3. [COCO 2014 Dataset (for YOLOv3)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jeffaudi/coco-2014-dataset-for-yolov3): The MS COCO (Microsoft Common Objects in Context) dataset is a large-scale object detection, segmentation, key-point detection, and captioning dataset. The dataset consists of 164K images.
4. [**YOLO**: Real-Time Object Detection](https://pjreddie.com/darknet/yolo/): You only look once (YOLO) is a state-of-the-art, real-time object detection system. On a Pascal Titan X it processes images at 30 FPS and has a mAP of 57.9% on COCO test-dev.
4. [The Complete Playing Card Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jaypradipshah/the-complete-playing-card-dataset): This dataset can be a good start for a Computer Vision Beginner. The dataset contains 53 classes and approximately 50 images for each class and the labels are in the Pascal-VOC format, COCO format and YOLO format.
5. [Guitar Transcription Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jacksonlightfoot/guitar-transcription-dataset):  It aims to provide well labeled training data for the purposes of developing automated guitar transcription.
